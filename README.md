# Text Encryptment Program ( @Mullins182 )

The Program encrypts and decrypts text added to its textboxes.
It generates a key while encrypting and inserts this key on a random position in the encrypted text, to be able to decrypt the text when added to its encrypted textbox.
It has an options menu where the encryptment and decryptment method can be changed and it provides also an automatic mode (Std = On) which decides which method is used depending 
on the text length of the encrypted text.
More options like setting the font-size of the textboxes font is coming soon.
